Keystone is a plug-in for FileMaker Pro that works on Mac and Windows. I think FileMaker Pro 7, 8, 9, and 10 are supported. I think server also, but I need testers. :)

FUNCTIONS:

So far, the only function it has is the ability to make SQL calls to your FileMaker database. This allows you to do finds and queries without relationships. You can even add & edit records without layouts or relationships, filter portals, and so on.

I would love help adding functions developers find useful. Join the team and let's build a free open-source plugin!

P.S. This product should not be confused with the excellent inRESONANCE KEYSTONE product, a full-featured student information system based on FileMaker Pro: http://developer.filemaker.com/solutions/detail/?item=solution.10000000203.
